## Getting Settled

When you first arrive at the Dhahran Techno-valelly company building, there will be a short
check-in. You’ll receive a badge to denote yourself as a hacker, and important information for the day of the event.
then we will move to the main Auditorium for the opening cermoney (more info will be provieded) and then start hacking.


### Asking for Help

There’ll be a point where you get stuck on something when working on
your project, whether it be a technical roadblock, a decision you don’t
have enough information to make, or a question about best practices. We
will have a few mentors during the event who will be around to answer
any technical questions, and there are also are probably other hackers
who might be familiar with what you are working with. Just send a
message to the *technical\_help* channel on Slack, and someone should
get back to you!
